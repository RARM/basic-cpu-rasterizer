# Basic CPU Rasterizer
This repository contains my attempt at creating a CPU-based rendering pipeline. The window and "context" creation is abstracted away with SDL. With SDL, I create a simple buffer which I use to generate the image.

I use [Nikita Lisita's blog](https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/posts/implementing-a-tiny-cpu-rasterizer-part-1.html) as a starting point, hopefully building on it, adding my own touch, and documenting along the way. Similar to the blog tutorial, I have milestones; they are organized into the different folders of this repository. Inside each folder, there is a README file with information. The READMEs may not contain detailed step-by-step instructions, but they offer helpful pointers. I try to document the code as best I can so that someone else can go through the folder and learn by stepping through it.

If you have any requests, please add an issue. I am also working on another repository (not public yet) with OpenGL documentation in a similar fashion.
